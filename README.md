[![Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/817780853.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13270428)

This repository contains all code and data required to generate the figures from

> A comprehensive Schizosaccharomyces pombe atlas of physical transcription factor interactions with proteins and chromatin

Each figure (and associated supplementary figures) is generated in a separate R Markdown (`.Rmd`) document. To reproduce a figure, simply render the corresponding `.Rmd` file (after installing the required packages).
